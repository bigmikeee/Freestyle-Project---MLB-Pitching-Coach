# Freestyle Project - MLB Pitching Coach
 Final Project for Intro to Python

# Installation
Along with downloading the above repository files, click the link below to access and download the raw example csv data to a local folder;
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0wT8w0YegSNKkAlD-1sYMcSd-8iZRnT/view?usp=sharing

Drag the savant_data csv file into the same location as your local repository "app" folder (code will not work if it is not in the same directory). Make sure it is in the same folder as "main.py"!

Open Terminal or Git Bash to run the MLB Pitching Coach. Navigate over to the directory where the app is located (i.e. C:\Users\micha\Desktop\Freestyle-Project---MLB-Pitching-Coach-main\app)

To create a new virtual environment run the following in the command line:
```
conda create --name pitchenv python
conda activate pitchenv
```

Install the necessary packages if they aren't already installed:
```
pip intall pandas
pip install pysimplegui
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

Once you have navigated over to the directory where you have cloned the local repository files, run the following in terminal to start the MLB Pitching Coach:

```
python main.py
```

Fill in the boxes and click "Submit." In order for the descriptive data to show in terminal, close the window or press "Exit."

# Troubleshooting
The program is recommended to be run in a new virtual environment. Be sure to have Microsoft C++ version 14.0 or higher in order to properly install matplotlib or else you will run into a package download error.
