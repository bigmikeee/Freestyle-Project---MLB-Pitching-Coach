# Freestyle Project - MLB Pitching Coach
 Final Project for Intro to Python

# Installation
Along with downloading the above repository files, click the link below to access and download the raw example csv data to a local folder;
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0wT8w0YegSNKkAlD-1sYMcSd-8iZRnT/view?usp=sharing

Drag the savant_data csv file into an easily accesible location (i.e. Desktop).

Open Terminal or Git Bash to run the MLB Pitching Coach.

Install the necessary packages if they aren't already installed:
```
pip intall pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install numpy


Once you have navigated over to the directory where you have cloned the local repository files, run the following in terminal to start the MLB Pitching Coach:

```
python main.py

# Troubleshooting
The program is recommended to be run in a base environment. If you decide to run a virtual environment, be sure to have Microsoft C++ version 14.0 or higher in order to properly install matplotlib.
